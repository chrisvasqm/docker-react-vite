# Docker + React + Vite Demo

Demostration project to show how to dockerize a React app that uses Vite.

## Requirements 🛑

1. Node
2. pnpm 
3. Docker
4. Code Editor/IDE

## Getting started

### Running the app locally 👨🏻‍💻

- Install all dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

- Start the app

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Build for production 🚀

Run the following command

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will generate a new folder called `dist` with the production-ready version of the app transpiled from TypeScript to JavaScript thanks to Vite and the TypeScript Compiler.
